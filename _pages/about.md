## About me

I am a PhD student specializing in deep reinforcement learning. I work especially on robot learning applied to object grasping. My driving force is my fascination for the intertwining of cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Every day I ask myself this very basic question: how do we learn so much without even realizing it?

Feel free to contact me, I would be happy to share with you my work or anything else.
