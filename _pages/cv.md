Currently
======
* Ph.D student in Machine Learning/Deep Reinforcement Learning
  * since 2020
  * Dissertation: _Deep Reinforcement Learning for soft object grasping_
  * Advisor: Prof. [Prof. Liming Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/limingchen/accueil)
* Interrogator in mathematics in the 5th best preparatory class in France, since 2020
  * since 2020
  * [Centre scolaire Aux Lazariste](https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-prepa/fiche/etablissement-centre-scolaire-aux-lazaristes-6257.html)
* Firefighter-engineer (reservist)
  * since 2018 
  * Paris Fire Brigade, France
  * I worked one year on a proof of concept of an embedded communication and localisation system based on LoRa/Mesh Wi-Fi/UWB. I used real-time optimization algorithm to acquire and treat various soft information.
  * Since 2019, I work part time in support of innovation topics such as indoor localization, indoor communication, etc.

Education
======
* Master's degree in Electronics, Energy, Electricity and Automation 2018-2019
  * Université Claude Bernard Lyon, France
* _Diplôme d’Ingénieur_ (M.S. and B.S. in Engineering Sciences) 2016-2019
  * Majoring in computer science
  * École Centrale de Lyon, France
* _Classe Préparatoire_ (equivalent to first two years of B.S. in the US) 2014-2016
  * Lycée Clemenceau, Nantes, France




Work experience
======
* Sring 2020: Research Internship,
  * LIRIS, UMR 5205 CNRS France
  * Deep Reinforcement Learning for soft objects grasping. 
  * [Report](../files/TFErapport.pdf)
  * [Repository](https://github.com/qgallouedec/panda-gym) 

* 2019 - 2020: Deep Learning Project
  * From visual and audio features of 66 movies ([MEDIAEVAL18 dataset](http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2018/)), the aim is to predict valence and arousal for each second of the movie. We use LSTM type RNNs, coded with PyTorch in Python, trained on cloud GPUs.
  * [Report](../files/Rapport_Emotion_Project.pdf)
  * [Repository](https://github.com/KongHag/emotion_project)

* Spring 2018: Research Internship
  * Polytechnique Montreal, Canada
  * Supervisor : [Prof. Maxime Raison](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/raison-maxime)
  * I developed a robotic arm with 3D printing for disabled children. The goal was to make the arm capable of playing tennis table. Computer vision and real-time algorithm to detect the ball and make the arm hit it.
