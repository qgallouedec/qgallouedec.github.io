## Currently

* **Since 2020:** Ph.D student in Machine Learning/Deep Reinforcement Learning
  * Dissertation: _Deep Reinforcement Learning for soft object grasping_
  * Advisor: Prof. [Prof. Liming Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/limingchen/accueil)
* **Since 2020:** Interrogator in mathematics
  * in the 5th best _Classe Préparatoire_*  in France, since 2020
  * [Centre scolaire Aux Lazariste](https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-prepa/fiche/etablissement-centre-scolaire-aux-lazaristes-6257.html)
* **Since 2018:** Firefighter-engineer (reservist)
  * Paris Fire Brigade, France
  * I worked one year on a proof of concept of an embedded communication and localisation system based on LoRa/Mesh Wi-Fi/UWB. I used real-time optimization algorithm to acquire and treat various soft information.
  * Since 2019, I work part time in support of innovation topics such as indoor localization, indoor communication, etc.

## Education

* **2016-2019:** _Diplôme d’Ingénieur_ (M.S. and B.S. in Engineering Sciences)
  * Majoring in computer science
* **2018-2019:** Master's degree in Electronics, Energy, Electricity and Automation
  * Université Claude Bernard Lyon, France
  * École Centrale de Lyon, France
* **2014-2016:**_Classe Préparatoire_*
  * Lycée Clemenceau, Nantes, France

## Work experience


* **Sring 2020:** Machine Learning Research Internship
  * LIRIS, UMR 5205 CNRS France
  * Deep Reinforcement Learning for soft objects grasping
  * [Report](../files/TFErapport.pdf)
  * [Repository](https://github.com/qgallouedec/panda-gym) 

* **2019 - 2020:** Deep Learning Project
  * From visual and audio features of 66 movies ([MEDIAEVAL18 dataset](http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2018/)), the aim is to predict valence and arousal for each second of the movie. We use LSTM type RNNs, coded with PyTorch in Python, trained on cloud GPUs.
  * [Report](../files/Rapport_Emotion_Project.pdf)
  * [Repository](https://github.com/KongHag/emotion_project)

* **Spring 2018:** Research Internship
  * Polytechnique Montreal, Canada
  * Supervisor : [Prof. Maxime Raison](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/raison-maxime)
  * I developed a robotic arm with 3D printing for disabled children. The goal was to make the arm capable of playing tennis table. Computer vision and real-time algorithm to detect the ball and make the arm hit it.

## Supervised student projects

* **2021:** Simulation and characterization of a tactile sensor for learning robotic tasks. (4 engineering students).
* **2020:** Soft-information for indoor positionning of firefighters (14 engineering students).

## Miscellaneous

* **2019:** National Defense Medalist for my commitment as a firefighter.
* **2012:** Winner of _Science et vie junior_ magazine's Innovez national contest.
* **Since 2011:** I am a black belt in Judo and I have been a national level athlete.


*: equivalent to first two years of B.S. in the US
